# tana-clipper
## Tana Paste Documentation
This extension relies on the **Tana Paste format** for structuring clippings.  

- See [docs/tana-paste-docs.pdf](./docs/tana-paste-docs.pdf) for the full specification.  
- For demo code and implementations, check [docs/demos/](./docs/demos/).  

This reference is critical for ensuring clipped content is valid when pasted into Tana.

## Demo Repos / Reference Code
This project also includes demos from other Tana Paste implementations.  
See [docs/demos/](./docs/demos/) for reference code in JavaScript, Swift, JSON, and more.  

These demos show practical examples of formatting and integration approaches.  
Theyâ€™re not part of the core extension, but serve as useful learning material.
